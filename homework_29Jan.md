#Theme Proposal:
##1. Nature/Flower Field
- mood board with some aesthetic art pieces as an inspiration.

Each scene could have some different flowers moving, butterflies flying and 
a forest scene with other animals, and so on. 
##2. 12 hours-12 Zodiac Signs. 
Inspiration from the Dior clock in NYC:

##3. University life/Life at NYUAD
- depicting everyday scenes that the audience could relate to in a fascinating moving machine performance.
8am could be waking up in a hurry and running to a class. 
1pm-going to lunch with friends at d2.
4pm-playing with cats.
22pm-cramming and studying hard at the library and so on.

#Research Topic Proposal:
##1. Teenage Engineering
-https://musictech.com/news/gear/teenage-engineering-new-choir-midi-compatible-wooden-dolls/
Specifically, their wooden dolls that "sing", I think it's a great example of the aesthetic enclosure of complex mechanisms and hardware.
Teenage Engineering is a Swedish consumer electronics company and manufacturer founded in 2005 by Jesper Kouthoofd, David Eriksson, 
Jens Rudberg and David Möllerstedt and based in Stockholm. Its products include electronics and synthesizers, with its core product 
being the OP-1 and instant cameras.

##2. Tom Haney

Tom Haney is an Ohio-born artist whose curiosity is driven by the mechanical movement itself. Although Haney's work can be plainly
described as 'kinetic art', his work is also sculptural in its traditional form while focusing on conceptual narratives as well.
His installations are a mode of storytelling, and a remembrance of the beautiful tradition of handmade.

##3."Souls and Machines" Exhibition
-https://www.artfutura.org/v3/en/souls-machines-exhibition/
The exhibition Souls and Machines explores the fact that, at the beginning of the 21st century, art and science move along parallel paths. 
And it does this through the work of a group of artists chosen for their ability to combine art, technology, mystery and beauty.
Its first presentation at the Reina Sofia Museum of Modern Art in Madrid drew more than 451.000 visitors, making it, arguably, 
the most visited exhibition of digital art up to date. It was exhibited during four months in the summer of 2008.
The artworks in the exhibition cover numerous Interactive Media techniques and mediums, from sensors to kinetic interaction, 
as well as various artists that could be useful for us to explore. 

##4. CHICO MACMURTRIE / AMORPHIC ROBOT WORKS
-https://amorphicrobotworks.org/
For over 15 years, the group Amorphic Robot Works, founded by Chico MacMurtrie, an artist from New Mexico, has been creating anthropomorphic 
and animal-like robotic sculptures for use in its installations and performances to express the dilemmas and conflicts of the human condition 
through the sculptures’ movements.
I especially got intrigued by his work as it includes movement mechanisms and some great sketches of how they should be executed. 
Organograph one reminded me of flower petals, which could be useful for the theme I proposed. https://amorphicrobotworks.org/organograph

##5.Bending machine
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending_machine_(manufacturing)#:~:text=A%20bending%20machine%20is%20a,the%20help%20of%20the%20kinematics.
A bending machine is a forming machine tool (DIN 8586). Its purpose is to assemble a bend on a workpiece. A bend is manufactured by using a bending tool 
during a linear or rotating move. The detailed classification can be done with the help of the kinematics

It is a great machine/tool that can help us bend and manipulate hard materials like metal and acrylic sheets 
for artistic and construction purposes. I have used heat-bending machine for acrylics, it was super easy and safe to use and
I was able to get angles without cutting the plaster.
