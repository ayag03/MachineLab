Research Topic Proposal:
1. Teenage Engineering-https://musictech.com/news/gear/teenage-engineering-new-choir-midi-compatible-wooden-dolls/
Specifically, their wooden dolls that "sing", I think it's a great example of the aesthetic enclosure of complex mechanisms and hardware.
Teenage Engineering is a Swedish consumer electronics company and manufacturer founded in 2005 by Jesper Kouthoofd, David Eriksson, 
Jens Rudberg and David MÃ¶llerstedt and based in Stockholm. Its products include electronics and synthesizers, with its core product

Tom Haney is an Ohio-born artist whose curiosity is driven by the mechanical movement itself. Although Haney's work can be plainly
described as 'kinetic art', his work is also sculptural in its traditional form while focusing on conceptual narratives as well.
His installations are a mode of storytelling, and a remembrance of the beautiful tradition of handmade.
3."Souls and Machines" Exhibition-https://www.artfutura.org/v3/en/souls-machines-exhibition/
The exhibition Souls and Machines explores the fact that, at the beginning of the 21st century, art and science move along parallel paths. 
And it does this through the work of a group of artists chosen for their ability to combine art, technology, mystery and beauty.
Its first presentation at the Reina Sofia Museum of Modern Art in Madrid drew more than 451.000 visitors, making it, arguably, the most visited exhibition of digital art up to date. It was exhibited during four months in the summer of 2008.
