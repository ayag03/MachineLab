# Carousel Progress #3-Aya, Evelyn, Ehtisham
Continuing from the last progress of our Carousel, we started connecting the power supplies, wires and Arduino
with the help of the slipring to our structure. 
First, we built the structure with the help of the metal square tube by bolting them
to the two circle wood base and tops of the carousel. Nelson was super helpful during this process by helping us to
cut the second wood circle as well as giving us the metal tube.
