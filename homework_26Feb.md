# ðŸŽ Carousel Progress #3-Aya, Evelyn, Ehtisham
Continuing from the last progress of our Carousel, we started connecting the power supplies, wires and Arduino
with the help of the Slipring to our structure.
## Supplying power through the Slipring while the carousel is rotating 
- First, we built the structure with the help of the metal square tube by bolting them
to the two circle wood base and tops of the carousel. Nelson was super helpful during this process by helping us to
cut the second wood circle as well as giving us the metal tube.

- Secondly, with the help of Professor Shiloh, we figured out how to connect and get power supplies from the bottom
of the carousel to the top, where we will connect Arduino, neopixels, and servo motors.

In order to do that, we connected the slipring to the bottom part of the Lazy Suzan, sorted out and organized the 12 wires, and soldered them together into 3 groups - 6 for the ground, 5 for the 5V Neopixels and servos as they take a lot of current, and 1 for the 9V arduino as it takes less current. We also used heat shrink tubing after soldering the wires to avoid any risks of open wire space and any loose connections that could happen during the movement.

- Next, before mounting the whole structure, we first checked all the wire connections by giving power to the Arduino and everything worked well!

- Finally, we mounted the metal square tube, placed the wires inside, connected them correspondingly to Arduino, powered the DC motor that rotates the carousel and verified that all the connection work well while rotating. Yay, success of the day!
